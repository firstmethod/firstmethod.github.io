    <h4>PREFACE</h4>
    <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress] </p>
    <p>This document is intended to describe the various facets of Eamon
      CS.&nbsp; The real documentation will be a formal set:&nbsp; full source
      code commenting, a Player's Manual, a Dungeon Designer's Manual and a
      Class Reference.&nbsp; It will take quite a while to put all that
      together, so in the meantime, hopefully, this will suffice. </p>
    <p>Eamon CS (ECS) is a port of the Eamon roleplaying game to the C#
      programming language.&nbsp; It is the production version of a prior system
      called Eamon AC (EAC), an ANSI C prototype intended to extract Eamon out
      of BASIC.&nbsp; If you have EAC on your system, you should uninstall it
      before using ECS, as it is now obsolete.</p>
    <p>This system is a hybrid of Donald Brown's Classic Eamon and the most
      modern BASIC Eamon available, Frank Black Production's Eamon Deluxe.&nbsp;
      It is also directly based on the EAC prototype.&nbsp; Eamon CS borrows
      liberally from and bears a strong resemblance to all these sources in
      various areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The game has evolved rapidly over its short lifespan.&nbsp; First, it
      moved to a plugin-based architecture unique to this branch of Eamon, then
      into the various flavors of Unix, and most recently into the Android
      mobile device space.&nbsp; The game engine has improved with each one of a
      small, but growing collection of custom-built adventures created along the
      way.&nbsp; The different facets of Eamon CS share a common code
      base.&nbsp; Where necessary it will be distinguished as Eamon CS Desktop
      for traditional workstations and Eamon CS Mobile for mobile devices. </p>
    <h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>
    <p>As mentioned in the README.md file, Eamon CS has no formal
      installer.&nbsp; There are good points and bad points to this.&nbsp; On
      the one hand, it is a simple matter of unzipping the Eamon-CS-master.zip
      file downloaded from GitHub to set up for play (if you did that, as
      opposed to doing a Git Clone).&nbsp; Also, it means there is no installer
      to maintain, which frees up time for other things like engine enhancements
      or developing adventures. </p>
    <p>A disadvantage to this approach is the ECS developer/gamer is responsible
      for installing all system prerequisites.&nbsp; Otherwise, ECS will not run
      when any of the .bat or .sh QuickLaunch files are double-clicked.&nbsp;
      Typically, this is manifested by a console window popping up and then
      disappearing quickly, caused by a missing dotnet.exe program.&nbsp; If you
      find that you cannot get Eamon CS to run on Windows, your first order of
      business should be to download and install the following files (in order):</p>

      .NET Core 2.2</a>
    <p>Note:&nbsp; Eamon CS should be fully compatible with new versions of .NET
      Core.&nbsp; If you wish to run the system using a more recent version of
      .NET Core, you can download VS 2019+ and recompile the Plugin Manager
      program to target it.&nbsp; The newer .NET Core must also be installed on
      your system.&nbsp; See the Post-Installation Topics section for more
      details. </p>
    <p>A second disadvantage on Windows leads to a useful tip regarding the
      downloaded .zip file.&nbsp; You should always right-click on the .zip file
      and select "unblock" to avoid the security warnings, as shown below:</p>

    <br>
    <p>The prerequisites on Unix are similar: a version of Mono that is .NET
      Framework 4.7.2+ and .NET Core 2.X compatible. The means to satisfy these
      requirements vary from platform to platform. Eamon CS on Unix should only
      be pursued by those who are confident enough to see it through via their
      own devices. The game runs correctly on Ubuntu Linux and FreeBSD, and may
      also work on other Unix variants. However, due to input-related issues, OS
      X requires a formal port to be done.</p>
    <h4>POST-INSTALLATION TOPICS</h4>
    <p>The binaries for Eamon CS are compiled to use .NET Core 2.X, but the
      system should be fully compatible with new versions of .NET Core that
      conform to .NET Standard 2.0.&nbsp; If you have a newer version of .NET
      Core on your system and don't want to download 2.X, you can recompile the
      EamonPM.WindowsUnix project to target it.&nbsp; To do this, you must first
      install Visual Studio 2019+, as described in the Prerequisites
      section.&nbsp; The use of Visual Studio is described in the section called
      Using The Visual Studio Debugger.&nbsp; The following screenshot shows how
      to determine which versions of .NET Core are present on your system:</p>

        src="../../assets/images/WorkingDraft/IncompatibleNetCoreError.jpg"> </div>
    <br>
    <p>To recompile the EamonPM.WindowsUnix project, load the Eamon.Desktop
      solution in Visual Studio.&nbsp; Right-click on the project and choose
      Properties.&nbsp; Select the appropriate version of .NET Core in the
      Target Framework drop-down list on the Application tab, then click the
      Save button:</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"

        title="CompileForNetCore3Plus.jpg" alt="CompileForNetCore3Plus.jpg" src="../../assets/images/WorkingDraft/CompileForNetCore3Plus.jpg">
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>After doing this, right-click on the EamonPM.WindowsUnix project and
      choose Clean.&nbsp; Then right-click on the project and select
      Build.&nbsp; If you receive no errors, Eamon CS should now work with your
      installed .NET Core.</p>
    <h4>PROGRAMS, LIBRARIES AND PLUGINS</h4>
    <p>The plugin-based architecture used by Eamon CS extends to the Main Hall,
      the Dungeon Designer, and all adventures.&nbsp; A Plugin Manager program
      specific to either Desktop or Mobile environments manages them:</p>

    <br>
    <p>Conceptually, each plugin is a discrete program.&nbsp; It exposes a
      Program class with a Main method that takes a collection of arguments,
      much like any C-based program.&nbsp; The difference is that the Plugin
      Manager is what "executes" the plugin, not the calling C#
      environment.&nbsp; At the bottom of the software stack, you have
      Polenter.SharpSerializer.dll which handles loading and saving of the
      game's textfiles and Eamon.dll which holds code common to all ECS
      plugins.&nbsp; EamonRT.dll contains the vanilla game engine used by all
      non-customized adventures.&nbsp; For customized adventures, the game
      plugin (e.g., TheBeginnersCave.dll) contains custom code specific to that
      game, built by leveraging EamonRT.dll.&nbsp; It is a "modded" version of
      the game engine.</p>
    <p>Plugins can share any logic with this implementation.&nbsp; For example,
      an interesting idea would be to create a "campaign library" that contains
      shared code for many derived adventures.</p>
    <p>The source code for Plugin Managers and system plugins resides in the
      appropriate directory under System; for adventures, it is in the
      adventure-specific directory under Adventures.</p>
    <p>The Main Hall textfiles reside in System\Bin, making them easily
      accessible to all plugins.&nbsp; Game-specific textfiles (both original
      and save game) reside under Adventures in their respective game
      directories.</p>
    <p>Here is a final note on the architectural differences between ECS Desktop
      and Mobile.&nbsp; For Desktop, the plugins reside in the System\Bin
      directory and are loaded by EamonPM.WindowsUnix.dll only when needed (and
      reused once loaded).&nbsp; In contrast, when building
      EamonPM.Android-Signed.apk, all plugins are statically linked in, and all
      textfiles are embedded, producing a monolithic application.&nbsp; When
      delivering the .apk onto the mobile device, the textfiles copy (when
      appropriate) to the device's file system - the plugins remain part of the
      application.&nbsp; In spite of this, the plugin managers are very similar
      internally.</p>
    <h4>BATCH FILES</h4>
    <p>The plugins take a variety of command-line parameters (described below).
      However, to get you up and running quickly, there is a QuickLaunch folder.
      (Since there is no formal ECS installer, you may want to create a shortcut
      to it on your desktop manually). Inside this folder is a set of batch
      files that you can run directly. The batch files organize into sub-folders
      based on the underlying plugin they invoke:</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup> Run these batch files to create a new character or send an
      existing one into the Main Hall. The only difference between the two batch
      files is the nature of the adventure database loaded (the same characters
      will be available regardless).</p>
    <p><sup>2</sup> Run these batch files to return to an in-progress adventure.
      Use the RESTORE command to pick up where you left off.</p>
    <p>You can study the batch files to see how the system launches various
      programs. You can also create new batch files using these as templates if
      you decide to write adventures or run the system in a non-default manner.</p>
    <p>Eamon CS Mobile mirrors this QuickLaunch hierarchy using a series of
      ListViews to provide a similar experience.</p>
    <h4>SUGGESTED GAMEPLAY SETTINGS</h4>
    <p>Eamon CS runs as a set of 64-bit Console applications. It became apparent
      during development that the default settings for Console windows are not
      ideal when playing a text-based game. The system tries to adjust the
      window size to an optimal setting, but you may wish to experiment with the
      other settings to see what appeals to you. Strangely enough, I've found
      aesthetics make a big difference in the quality of the gameplay as well as
      the ease of use for tools like EamonDD. This topic is highly subjective,
      but the following ideas produced some interesting results:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>When running ECS, right-click on the Console window title bar and
        choose properties. Windows 10 provides the following settings; the
        properties available on other versions may differ.</li>

    <p>Eamon CS tries to set the values on the Layout Tab to those shown above,
      so you shouldn't need to change them. The Screen Buffer Width and Window
      Width should always be 80 columns. The Screen Buffer Height is strongly
      suggested to be 9999. The Screen Text shown above is Green with a Black
      background and has a retro-vibe to it, like an Apple II monitor. If you
      prefer amber the RGB values [255,165,0] might work for you. As time has
      passed, I settled on a white background with black text, as shown in the
      various images in this document. Once you have the settings you're happy
      with, click OK and they should persist across ECS programs.</p>
    <p>The newest versions of Windows (10+) contain a rewritten command console
      program (CMD.exe). It seems to have bugs that produce intermittent cursor
      artifacts in Eamon CS. If you are experiencing this issue, you might try
      running the command console in legacy mode. Right-click on any Eamon CS
      console window, choose Properties, and then the Options tab. Ensure the
      Use Legacy Console checkbox is checked:</p>

    <p>The parser of the game has been enhanced to allow more flexible input.
      You can enter stuff like "PUT my sword INSIDE my backpack" or "OPEN that
      jewelry box" or "ATTACK the rats" or "GIVE the spices TO the hermit". The
      standard [VERB] [subject1] [subject2] pattern of Eamon Deluxe remains, but
      ECS will discard the articles before processing further. Even though it is
      more typing, some players may find it more immersive. Of course, you can
      always use the compact syntax if you prefer.</p>
    <p>The system has been enhanced to support a variety of container types. You
      can store contents in, on, under, or behind depending on the container.
      Under and Behind Containers are similar to In Containers, but cannot be
      opened or closed and have no key. On Containers have special behavior, the
      contents are exposed and can be manipulated using any standard command.</p>
    <p>The game engine contains a few new commands, summarized below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"INFO" gives information about the played adventure.</li>
      <br>
      <li>"SETTINGS" allows you to control a variety of general and
        game-specific configuration options. You can change your settings at any
        point. It is a good idea to use this command when a game is started to
        see what's available to you.</li>
      <br>
      <li>"HINTS" gives you a list of hints for the current adventure. You
        should always carefully read EAMON CS 1.6 GENERAL HELP and EAMON CS 1.6
        NEW COMMANDS as these hints may be subtly different than their Eamon
        Deluxe counterparts. Consider the following:</li>
      <br>
      <li>"GO" [door] allows you to pass through a free-standing non-directional
        door (e.g., the overgrown path in Test Adventure).</li>
      <br>
      <li>"INVENTORY" [container] is a parallel to "INVENTORY" [monster]. This
        command lists the container's contents, and typically only works with In
        Containers and On Containers. </li>
      <br>
      <li>EXAMINE or LOOK [in|on|under|behind] [container] can also be used to
        list the contents of a container. These verbs are sensitive to the
        preposition used and will display the appropriate content list if any.
        There are a variety of prepositional synonyms available. If you use a
        preposition unrelated to containment (or none at all), it will result in
        the default behavior where the description is displayed. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>QUICK ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW</h4>
    <p>The entire Eamon CS system was written from scratch and aggressively
      exploits the C# language. Not just a port, this is an expansive toolkit
      used to build games based on the Eamon ruleset. It has more in common with
      traditional Interactive Fiction systems like TADS or Inform. Eamon CS
      games are built by sub-classing existing classes in any library/plugin,
      but especially Eamon.dll or EamonRT.dll, and overriding default behavior
      where needed. You can subclass every class in the system, and generic
      improvements made to individual adventures can be pushed back into the
      base framework for use by all games. As time goes on, the system will grow
      in flexibility and power.</p>
    <p>The textfile format used by Eamon CS deserves an explanation. The game
      produces ASCII XML files that represent C# object graphs, a radical data
      storage paradigm shift. These files also play a critical role in the
      development of customized adventures. Take a look in the MONSTERS.XML file
      in Test Adventure (a non-customized adventure), and you will see the
      serialized class is Eamon.Game.Monster (from Eamon.dll). But in The
      Beginner's Cave, you will see it's TheBeginnersCave.Game.Monster (from
      TheBeginnersCave.dll). These are two different classes, the second is a
      subclass of the first, and implements custom code that is explicitly used
      by The Beginner's Cave. Now compare the batch file EditTestAdventure.bat,
      which contains the command-line argument "-pfn EamonRT.dll" with
      EditTheBeginnersCave.bat, which includes "-pfn TheBeginnersCave.dll". In
      the first, the flag instructs EamonDD to load the base engine. In the
      second, it loads TheBeginnersCave.dll and uses any customized classes it
      finds (like the Monster class) when creating new objects. This whole topic
      is fairly complex and begs to be part of a formal document set, but at
      least this gives you an idea of how it works.</p>
    <p>With BASIC Eamons that use files containing just data, you can bypass the
      Dungeon Designer program altogether and build these files by hand. You
      should avoid this practice in Eamon CS due to the specialized textfile
      format. The EamonDD program is instrumental in producing textfiles of the
      correct format, and you should rely on it to do so. However, you can still
      manually tweak the textfiles with your favorite editor. Just be very
      careful not to violate the file format, as the
      Polenter.SharpSerializer.dll library can be picky.</p>
    <p>The EamonRT.dll base adventure runtime takes the form of a Finite State
      Machine (FSM). For those unfamiliar, this is a technique used to model
      complex program behavior. The main game loop is 15 lines long; all complex
      behavior resides in subclasses of the State class. Player commands derive
      from the Command class, which is itself derived from State. Customized
      adventures will almost always subclass various States or Commands to
      provide specialized behavior. It is also straightforward to create new
      States or Commands and link them into the FSM if needed. Finally, if you
      look through the code, you will see that special care has been taken to
      avoid the use of GOTO except in specific circumstances (goto Cleanup).
      Doing this gives the game engine a clean, deterministic quality.</p>
    <h4>USING THE VISUAL STUDIO DEBUGGER</h4>
    <p>Eamon CS was built with Visual Studio 2019, a powerful, modern integrated
      development environment (IDE) used by programmers worldwide. It can be
      obtained through a link in the Prerequisites section. Many tutorials on
      the web explore Visual Studio in detail; that topic is outside the scope
      of this document. If you do some research on your own, make sure to focus
      on using the debugger, which will be the point of this section. The IDE
      can be used to develop new games, modify existing games, and step through
      the source code to clarify its inner workings. This discussion assumes VS
      2019 on Windows; if you're in a different development environment or a
      different OS, the steps may vary. To step through the Eamon CS source
      code, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a backup of your repository directory if you downloaded a .zip
        file. If you Git Cloned the system, you can make a new development
        branch and focus your work there. Your original branch (or gameplay
        branch) will remain pristine.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In the development directory or branch run
        EnterMainHallUsingAdventures.bat, and send a character into the
        adventure you want to step through. You can save the game if you wish,
        but it is not required; only that the character remains in the
        adventure. Quit the game, but don't Quit Hall. In this example, we'll
        step through The Sub-Aquan Laboratory.</li>

    <h4>BUILDING NEW ADVENTURES</h4>
    <p>With Eamon CS, it is still possible to send adventurers to their death
      for fun and profit, even after all these years! You can create new games
      with the tools available to you. Standard adventures - that is, those that
      use the EamonRT generic game engine and have no custom programming - can
      be built without Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition installed. But
      Custom adventures (like The Beginner's Cave, etc.) require the VS tool
      suite to be on your system. Up to this point, it has been a manual effort
      to bootstrap new games. But significant progress has been made towards
      fully automating the process. You will find in the EamonDD folder under
      QuickLaunch a new .bat or .sh file that when run, will enable an Adventure
      Support Menu under Utilities. This file is LoadAdventureSupportMenu:</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"

        title="LoadAdventureSupportMenu.jpg" alt="LoadAdventureSupportMenu.jpg"

        src="../../assets/images/WorkingDraft/LoadAdventureSupportMenu.jpg"> </div>
    <br>
    <p>Depending on your system configuration, there may be a few manual steps
      that you must do if you plan to create Custom adventures. Perform these
      steps if necessary, before launching this menu for the first time.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There is a new project in Eamon.Desktop called EamonVS that integrates
        with the Microsoft EnvDTE automation library. EnvDTE is omitted from
        Eamon CS as it is not on Microsoft's redistribution list. But it was
        placed on your system when you installed Visual Studio. EamonVS includes
        it as a reference. The EamonDD program uses EamonVS to automate the
        process of adding new Custom adventure projects to Eamon.Adventures and
        to recompile the solution. Note the following two scenarios:</li>
      <br>
      <li>Scenario #1: If you are using Visual Studio 2019 Community, installed
        in the default location, you should be ready to go right now. Open
        Eamon.Desktop, right-click on the EamonVS project and Build it. If the
        Build succeeds, skip to the section of text after Step 8. (If the Build
        fails because it can't find EnvDTE.dll, you're in Scenario #2 - see
        below).</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"

    </div>
    <br>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Scenario #2: If you are using Visual Studio 2019, installed in a
        non-default location, or you're using a non-Community Edition (e.g.,
        Professional or Enterprise). You will have to remove the EnvDTE
        reference from EamonVS, locate EnvDTE in your Visual Studio directory
        hierarchy, and re-add it as a reference to EamonVS. The EnvDTE library
        should be about 256KB in size. Once you do this, you should be able to
        compile EamonVS.</li>

        correct file and choose Open File Location. Copy the full directory path

        (but not .sh) and append to the end of the dotnet launch string the -dep

    <p> Before proceeding further, if you downloaded the .zip file for Eamon CS,
      it might make sense to back up your repository so you can revert if
      necessary. For those who cloned the repository from GitHub, it might make
      sense to create a branch for your new adventure so you can back out at any
      time.</p>
    <p> Once you have performed any manual steps listed above, you will be able
      to run LoadAdventureSupportMenu. Creating adventures requires entering
      just a few key pieces of data. The automated process uses resources
      embedded within the EamonDD plugin:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates the game folder under Adventures</li>
      <li>Generates all needed code (Custom adventures only)</li>
      <li>Creates all necessary QuickLaunch .bat and .sh files</li>
      <li>Adds game to appropriate Adventure database(s)</li>
      <li>Adds game project to Eamon.Adventures.sln (Custom adventures only)</li>
      <li>Rebuilds Eamon.Adventures.sln, producing game library (Custom
        adventures only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Below we see an example of Custom adventure creation where a new game
      called Walled City of Darkness (Eamon #150) is bootstrapped using the
      Adventure Support Menu.</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"

        title="AddGame.jpg" alt="AddGame.jpg" src="../../assets/images/WorkingDraft/AddGame.jpg">
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The only thing you need to do to play your game after all this is run the
      game's Edit[YourAdventureName] .bat or .sh file and add:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Module record</li>
      <li>A Room record</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For Custom adventures, a complete set of derived foundational classes
      (e.g., Artifact, Monster, Room, Engine, etc.) are generated and available
      for you to modify. The generated classes should be sufficient for many
      Custom games. But remember you can always add your own new or overridden
      classes if you need to get exotic. There are two additional menu options,
      detailed below, that allow you to add and remove classes programmatically.
      Every facet of the system is built to override, so the sky is the limit
      here. The actual process of customization using Visual Studio 2019 is
      beyond the scope of this section. It will be fully documented elsewhere,
      although there are games available to look at for ideas.</p>
    <p>Finally, a word about submissions: anyone who wishes to build a game and
      have it included in Eamon CS should contact me to discuss the matter
      before beginning any work. The contact info is in AUTHORS.txt under
      Documentation. You should always build a new game in a unique branch off
      master, so it cleanly merges when completed. There may be suggestions for
      improvements when reviewing the code in the branch. It is no cause for
      concern, just part of the process of building the best game possible. The
      goal of doing this is to enhance the experience for people who discover
      Eamon CS and play it in the future. At this point, I have yet to fully
      work out the logistics of game developer pull requests against master.</p>
    <h4>ADDING CUSTOM ADVENTURE CLASSES</h4>
    <p>Custom games are created in Eamon CS using the C# mechanism of
      sub-classing. The system has no sealed classes, and every property and
      method is declared virtual. You can override any aspect of the game engine
      to suit your needs. If you want to produce a complex, interesting game
      with lots of special effects, you will almost certainly need to create new
      classes for your adventure. There are numerous examples of this in the
      adventures contained in the Eamon.Adventures solution. It turns out, the
      layout of folders and namespaces in Eamon CS lends itself to a simple code
      generation mechanism based on a template discovered while studying the
      already-created games. You can use the Adventure Support Menu to generate
      custom classes, complete with matching interfaces (if needed), based on
      many classes in the Eamon, EamonDD or EamonRT libraries. These generated
      classes appear in the selected adventure, and then you are free to add
      your custom code. For any class with a corresponding .XML file (e.g.,
      Room.cs and ROOMS.XML), the .XML file will be updated to reflect the newly
      added class.</p>
    <p>While the code generator works great with classes that fit the template,
      it may fail with others that don't, so this comes with a caveat. <i>Always
        verify the generated code is what you are expecting. Depending on the
        class, sometimes the code will be flawed, and your game won't compile;
        other times it will compile but be subtly wrong.</i> Visual Studio's
      Intellisense can help identify problematic code that needs fixing. Since
      this menu option is intended only as a bootstrapper, you can take the
      output verbatim or modify it to better suit your needs. Also, remember you
      can always bypass this convenience and craft your code by hand.</p>
    <p>The following example demonstrates the adding of several new classes to
      the previously created Walled City of Darkness adventure. (Note the
      adventure has been pre-processed to remove the Hint.cs file.)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You have several options when using this menu item. You can generate
        stand-alone classes, stand-alone interfaces, or class/interface pairs.
        If you create an independent class and then later decide to generate its
        matching interface, you will have to update the class manually to derive
        from the new interface. If you create a matching class/interface pair,
        the interface won't appear if it already exists. File paths are
        specified relative to the working directory System.</li>

      <li>The code generator places classes and interfaces in the adventure
        folder. The system automatically builds a directory hierarchy that
        mirrors that of the Eamon CS base libraries. Classes go under the Game
        folder, interfaces under Framework. At this point, you can add your
        custom code.</li>

        flags as being invalid, and also hover over the various parts of the
        code to ensure the specified classes/interfaces are correct.</li>

      <li>When adding custom code, type public override or protected override
        and choose the right property or method from the list presented by
        Intellisense. It is often useful to refer to (or use code from) the
        parent classes in the Eamon CS base libraries, but when the existing
        games migrated to the Eamon.Adventures solution they were changed to use
        file referencing rather than project referencing. Unfortunately, this
        prevents quick navigation to the parent classes using the typical
        right-click and Go to Definition or Go to Implementation. Doing this
        brings up only metadata. There are third-party tools that can overcome
        this limitation using library de-compilation, but in general, they are
        commercial products with no Community Edition available. To overcome
        this, you can open two copies of Visual Studio, one with Eamon.Desktop
        loaded, the other with Eamon.Adventures. Then when you want to access a
        parent class, method or property, type the name into the Search Bar and
        double click the found item. Doing this appears to be the best option
        available.</li>

    <h4>DELETING CUSTOM ADVENTURE CLASSES</h4>
    <p>You can delete custom adventure classes just as quickly as you add them
      using the Adventure Support Menu. There are many reasons you may wish to
      do this. When you create a new adventure via the Add A Custom Adventure
      menu option, the system generates a complete set of foundational classes
      for it. But you will often find that you don't need all the classes
      produced. A generated class is only useful if you plan on overriding
      methods or properties in it; otherwise, it is just extraneous code bloat.
      There may be other times you are implementing some unique game behavior
      when you run into trouble and decide to restart the work or scrap it
      entirely.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the reason, you can use the Delete Custom Adventure Classes
      menu option to delete one or more classes or interfaces from the game. If
      you have classes that are reliant on explicitly deleted interfaces your
      game will not compile until the classes are fixed or removed. If you
      delete classes, any paired interfaces will automatically delete as well.
      If the removed class has a corresponding .XML file (e.g., Room.cs and
      ROOMS.XML) it will be updated to reflect the appropriate parent class.
      There is no undoing this operation so you should back up your work if
      there is a chance you'll change your mind.</p>
    <p>The following example demonstrates the removal of several classes from
      the Walled City of Darkness adventure.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You have several options when using this menu item. You can delete
        classes, interfaces, or both. File paths are specified relative to the
        adventure folder.</li>
    </ol>

    </div>
    <br>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>The classes selected for deletion are no longer in the project, and
        their matching interfaces are gone as well.</li>
    </ol>

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"

        title="DeleteClasses02.jpg" alt="DeleteClasses02.jpg" src="../../assets/images/WorkingDraft/DeleteClasses02.jpg">
    </div>
    <br>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>One of the deleted classes, Hint.cs, has a matching HINTS.XML file.
        Notice that the data type is no longer WalledCityOfDarkness.Game.Hint
        but was reverted to the parent class Eamon.Game.Hint.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>DELETING EXISTING ADVENTURES</h4>
    <p>You can also delete adventures from Eamon CS if the need arises. Maybe
      you were experimenting with a game scenario that didn't work out or have
      fully played through a title and want to make space on your file system.
      Perhaps you don't like an adventure and want to purge it from your Eamon
      CS repository. Whatever the reasons, the Adventure Support Menu has an
			option to do game deletion. Choosing this menu option will cause the
      system to prompt you for some key pieces of data and verify that you
      want to proceed. If so, it will completely remove all traces of the
      adventure from your Eamon CS system by doing the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deletes game library/binary files (Custom adventures only)</li>
      <li>Removes the game project from Eamon.Adventures.sln (Custom adventures only)</li>
      <li>Removes the game from appropriate Adventure database(s)</li>
      <li>Leaves the game folder under Adventures intact (but you can manually delete it yourself)</li>
      <li>Deletes the game QuickLaunch .bat and .sh files</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you delete a custom adventure in Unix, you will have to remove the game
      project manually from Eamon.Adventures.sln since Visual Studio integration
      is not available on that platform.</p> 
    <p>As you might expect, once a game has been deleted its data is not recoverable
      by normal means.</p>

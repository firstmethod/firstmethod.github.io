    <h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>
    <p>As mentioned in the README.md file, Eamon CS has no formal
      installer.&nbsp; There are good points and bad points to this.&nbsp; On
      the one hand, it is a simple matter of unzipping the Eamon-CSmaster.zip
      file downloaded from GitHub to set up for play (if you did that, as
      opposed to doing a Git Clone).&nbsp; Also, it means there is no installer
      to maintain, which frees up time for other things like engine enhancements
      or developing adventures. </p>
    <p>A disadvantage to this approach is the ECS developer/gamer is responsible
      for installing all system prerequisites.&nbsp; Otherwise, ECS will not run
      when any of the .bat or .sh QuickLaunch files are double-clicked.&nbsp;
      Typically, this is manifested by a console window popping up and then
      disappearing quickly, caused by a missing dotnet.exe program.&nbsp; If you
      find that you cannot get Eamon CS to run on Windows, your first order of
      business should be to download and install the following files (in order):</p>

    <p>Note:&nbsp; Eamon CS should be fully compatible with new versions of .NET
      Core.&nbsp; If you wish to run the system using a more recent version of
      .NET Core, you must download VS 2019+ and recompile the Plugin Manager
      program to target it.&nbsp; The newer .NET Core must also be installed on
      your system.&nbsp; See the Post-Installation Topics section for more
      details. </p>
    <p>A second disadvantage on Windows leads to a useful tip regarding the
      downloaded .zip file.&nbsp; You should always right-click on the .zip file
      and select "unblock" to avoid the security warnings, as shown below:</p>

    The prerequisites on Unix are similar: a version of Mono that is .NET
    Framework 4.7.2+ and .NET Core 2.X compatible. The means to satisfy these
    requirements vary from platform to platform. Eamon CS on Unix should only be
    pursued by those who are confident enough to see it through via their own
    devices. The game runs correctly on Ubuntu Linux and FreeBSD, and may also
    work on other Unix variants. However, due to input-related issues, OS X
    requires a formal port to be done.<br>

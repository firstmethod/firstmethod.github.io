    <h4>1. PREFACE</h4>
    <p>[Note:&nbsp; this document is a work in progress] </p>
	<p>For those who wish to start playing Eamon CS immediately, this Quick Start Guide summarizes
	the Players Manual, which dives deeper into the game's details.  But it's still highly recommended
	you read through the Players Manual at least once.  You will gain a better understanding of the
	Eamon CS system and the history and mechanics of the world of Eamon in general.</p>
	<p>The QSG uses terminology with which you should be familiar.  "Rooms" are discrete locations on
	the game map typically linked together using compass directions.  "Artifacts" refer to inanimate
	objects in the game world recognized by the parser; they can be interacted with and manipulated.
	"Embedded Artifacts" are only evident upon careful examination of something else's description
	(typically a room or other artifact).  "Monsters" refer to animate or living entities in the game
	world recognized by the parser; they can be interacted with.  The game database stores all this
   information and uses it to drive the adventure.</p>

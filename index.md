The Eamon text adventure game, originally created by Donald Brown, debuted many years ago on the Apple II.  It still enjoys a following to this day due to its nostalgic appeal and the rise of retrogaming.

The system itself is unique - text-based adventuring with heavy roleplaying (RPG) elements, and a modular structure that lends itself to user built scenarios.
